This is a program that will give you the weather updates in any city you search as well as a 5 day forcast. This is useful for planning trips, preparing for your drive to and from work, dressing accordingly to the forcast... etc. The api also gives you additional information such as temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and UV Index.
